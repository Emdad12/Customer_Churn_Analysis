### Project Overview :  
---
This project involves analyzing customer churn data to gain insights into customer behavior and identify key factors influencing churn. The analysis was conducted using Power BI, leveraging its powerful visualization and analytical tools to create an interactive dashboard for better decision-making.

### Key Objectives
- Understand customer churn patterns and trends.
- Identify factors that contribute to customer churn.
- Provide actionable insights to reduce churn rates and improve customer retention strategies.
### Tools and Technologies Used:
- Power BI for data visualization and dashboard creation.

- Excel for preliminary data cleaning and transformation.
### Approach
1.Data Preparation:

- Cleaned and transformed raw data using Power BI's Power Query Editor.
- Handled missing values, inconsistent data types, and created calculated fields where necessary.
- Handled Outliers: Removed unusually high or low values
2.Data Modeling:
   
- Established relationships between tables for an efficient data model.
- Implemented measures and calculated columns for key metrics like churn rate, customer lifetime value, and retention rate.  
3.Visualization:
  
- Designed an interactive dashboard with visuals such as bar charts, line charts, pie charts, and slicers.  
### Key Insights
- High churn rates were observed in specific customer segments and regions.
- Key drivers of churn included product pricing and customer support issues.
- Retention strategies, such as loyalty programs and targeted marketing, could potentially mitigate churn.
### Results/Findings:
The analysis provided actionable insights for management to address churn, leading to improved customer satisfaction and retention rates.
### Future Enhancements 
- Integrate predictive models using Power BI and Python to forecast churn probability.
- Expand analysis with additional data sources, such as customer satisfaction surveys or social media sentiment analysis.
